//Task-3
//Write a function called make_avg() which will take an array of integers and the size of that array and return the average of those values.

//Task-4
//Write a function called count_zero() which will take a binary string (Binary string is a string which is consist of only 0 and 1) as parameter and count how many 0â€™s are there in that string.

//Task-5
//Write a function called odd_even() which takes an integer value and tells whether this value is even or odd. If even return Even. If odd return Odd
